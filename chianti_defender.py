# This bot tries to catch an enemy bot. It will stop at the border of its
# homezone if the enemy still did not cross the border.
# As long as the enemies are far away (their position is noisy), the bot
# tries to get near to the bot in the enemy team which has the same turn.
# As soon as an enemy bot is not noisy anymore, i.e. it has come near, the
# bot goes after it and leaves the other enemy alone
